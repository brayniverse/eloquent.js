## What is Eloquent?

Eloquent.js is a framework agnostic data management library written in JavaScript that aims to simplify synchronizing data between clients and servers. It does so by providing a unified API for retrieving data from any HTTP endpoint (URL) while offering complete control over the request and response objects.

Eloquent.js draws inspiration from some of the best most expressive data/ORM projects such as [Active Record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern), [Laravel's Eloquent](http://laravel.com/docs/eloquent), [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) and [ngActiveResource](https://github.com/FacultyCreative/ngActiveResource).
